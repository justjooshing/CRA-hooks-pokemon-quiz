## Pokemon Quiz

A rebuilt version ES6 of the pokemon quiz app that I made, using create-react-app, React hooks, and Redux this time, instead of class-based components.

### Usage

Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

Start server

```
npm start
```

Since this is built with Create-React-App, a browser tab will open for you at localhost:3000
